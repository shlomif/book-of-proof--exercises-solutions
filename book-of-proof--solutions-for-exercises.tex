\section{Chapter 4}

\subsection{Exercise 1}

Given: x is even.

x is even so $x = 2a$ for some $ a \in Z $ . Therefore,
$ x^2 = (2a)^2 = 4a^2 = 2\cdot(2\cdot a^2)$. As a result, $x^2 = 2b$
for some integer $b = 2 \cdot a^2 $ and is even.

\subsection{Exercise 2}

Given: x is an odd integer.

Since x is odd, then it can be written as $x = 2a+1$ for some $a \in Z$.

As a result:
$x^3 = (2a+1)^3 = 8a^3 + 12a^2 + 6a + 1 = 2\left(4a^3+6a^2+3a\right) + 1 $.

One can see that $x^3 = 2b+1$ for $b = 4a^3+6a^2+3a$ and is therefore odd.

Q.E.D.
